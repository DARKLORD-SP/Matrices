# Matrices
<<<<<<< HEAD
Multiple Type Matrix Class Implementation There is Vector3Matrix, Vector2Matrix, FloatMatrix, IntMatrix Classes Implemented which can hold n number of rows and n number of columns and perform some basic operations on it.

Example: Suppose you want to Create a Float Type Matrix.

Steps : 
  1) Import Matrix.dll into your Unity Project.
  2) open the class in which you want to create the Matrix.
  3) Add Using Matrices; Statement so you can access the matrix classes
 
Now you can Create A Float Type Matrix by giving rows and column as a parameter.
  
    FloatMatrix _floatMatix = new FloatMatrix(2, 3);  


NOTE: This Project is WORK IN PROGRESS

Features Coming are 
-More Operations On Matrices. 
-Type Support for Matrices vector4
